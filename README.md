Raw Gadget
==========

[Raw Gadget](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/usb/raw-gadget.rst) is a Linux kernel module that implements a low-level interface for the Linux USB Gadget subsystem.
It is similar to GadgetFS, but provides greater flexibility; see all the differences [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/usb/raw-gadget.rst).

Raw Gadget can be used to emulate USB devices, both physical and virtual ones.
Emulating physical devices requires a Linux board with a [USB Device Controller](/README.md#usb-device-controllers) (UDC), such as a Raspberry Pi.
Emulating virtual devices requires no hardware and instead relies on the [Dummy HCD/UDC](/dummy_hcd) module (such devices get connected to the kernel Raw Gadget is running on).

This repository contains instructions and [examples](/examples) for using Raw Gadget.

Raw Gadget has been [merged](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f2c2e717642c66f7fe7e5dd69b2e8ff5849f4d10) into the mainline Linux kernel in `5.7`.
There's no need to use `5.7+` kernels; see [raw_gadget](/raw_gadget) and [dummy_hcd](/dummy_hcd) for information on how to build and `insmod` corresponding modules on older kernels.
The modules should be compatible with kernel versions down to `4.14`; see the table below.

Building the Raw Gadget and Dummy HCD/UDC kernel modules requires kernel headers.
On desktop Ubuntu, you can get them by installing `` linux-headers-`uname -r` ``.
On a Raspberry Pi, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/rpi-source).

See the [Fuzzing USB with Raw Gadget](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sArf2cN5tAOaovlaL3KBPNDjYOk8P6tRrzfkclsbO_c/edit?usp=sharing) talk [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT3PQjKxa_c)] for details about Linux Host and Gadget USB subsystems and Raw Gadget.

__Note__:
Do not use Raw Gadget in production for emulating USB devices with concrete classes.
Instead, use the [composite framework](https://docs.kernel.org/usb/gadget_configfs.html) or the [legacy gadget driver modules](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/usb/gadget/legacy).
Raw Gadget is intended for fuzzing and exploiting USB hosts or for proxying USB devices.


## Limitations

While Raw Gadget does support emulating a wide range of USB device types, it has a set of known limitations.

Most notably, there is:

- No support for isochronous transfers (see https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget/issues/60);
- No support for USB 3 SuperSpeed device emulation (see https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget/issues/61);

Both of these are not foundational limitations of the technology but rather just features missing from the implementation.
They might addressed in the future.

Also see [TODOs](#todo) for a list of other more minor missing features.


## USB Device Controllers

Raw Gadget requires the user to provide the UDC device and driver names.
This allows using Raw Gadget with a particular UDC if a few of them are present on the system.

UDC device names can be found in `/sys/class/udc/`:

``` bash
$ ls /sys/class/udc/
dummy_udc.0
```

The UDC driver name is usually present in `/sys/class/udc/$UDC/uevent`:

``` bash
$ cat /sys/class/udc/dummy_udc.0/uevent
USB_UDC_NAME=dummy_udc
```

Below is a table of UDCs that were tested with Raw Gadget.

| Hardware | Kernel | Driver | Device | Works? |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| | `5.3.0-45-generic` | `dummy_udc` | `dummy_udc.0` | [Yes](/tests#dummy-udc) |

| Khadas VIM1 | `5.10.60-meson64` | `c9100000.usb` | `c9100000.usb` | [Yes](/tests#khadas-vim1) |
| [ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6](https://xairy.io/articles/thinkpad-xdci) | `5.15.0-107-generic` | `dwc3-gadget` | `dwc3.1.auto` | [Yes](/tests#thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-6) |
| BeagleBone Black | `4.19.94-ti-r42` | `musb-hdrc` | `musb-hdrc.0` | Probably |
| BeagleBone AI | `4.14.108-ti-r131` | `dwc3-gadget` | `48890000.usb` | Probably |
| [EC3380-AB](http://www.hwtools.net/Adapter/EC3380-AB.html) | `5.3.0-45-generic` | `net2280` | `0000:04:00.0` (e.g.) | Partially,<br />`net2280` buggy |
| Odroid C2 | `3.14.79-116` | `dwc_otg_pcd` | `dwc2_a` | No, kernel too old |

"Works" in the table above means that the UDC passes the provided [tests](/tests), which only cover a [subset of functionality](/tests#todo).


## Facedancer backend

There's a [prototype](https://github.com/xairy/Facedancer/tree/rawgadget) of a Facedancer backend based on Raw Gadget.

This backend relies on a few out-of-tree Raw Gadget patches present in the [dev branch](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget/tree/dev).
Once the backend is thoroughly tested, these patches will be submitted to the mainline.

Raw Gadget-based backend accepts a few parameters through environment variables:

| Parameter | Description | Default value |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `RG_UDC_DRIVER` | UDC driver name | `dummy_udc` |
| `RG_UDC_DEVICE` | UDC device name | `dummy_udc.0` |
| `RG_USB_SPEED` | USB device speed | `3` (High Speed) |

Example of using Facedancer with Raw Gadget to emulate a USB keyboard on a Raspberry Pi 4:

``` bash
export BACKEND=rawgadget
export RG_UDC_DRIVER=fe980000.usb
export RG_UDC_DEVICE=fe980000.usb
./legacy-applets/facedancer-keyboard.py
```

Note: Some Facedancer examples might fail if a wrong USB speed is specified.
Failures happen either with `EINVAL` in `USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP_ENABLE`, with `ESHUTDOWN` in `USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP_READ/WRITE`, or can be completely random.
For example, with Dummy UDC, `examples/ftdi-echo.py` requires `RG_USB_SPEED=2` and `legacy-applets/facedancer-ftdi.py` requires `RG_USB_SPEED=3`.
In turn, `legacy-applets/facedancer-umass.py` requires `RG_USB_SPEED=2`.

Note: This backend is still a prototype.
Outstanding tasks:

1. Rebase the backend onto [Facedancer 3.0 release](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/facedancer/issues/79).
2. Make sure that all [required backend callbacks](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/facedancer/issues/48) are implemented. For example, `read_from_endpoint` should probably be implemented.
3. Provide a common [Python wrapper](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget/issues/1) for Raw Gadget ioctls, and use it in the backend.
4. Finalize and submit out-of-tree Raw Gadget patches to the mainline.

Note: Facedancer assumes that every backend supports non-blocking I/O, which is not the case for Raw Gadget.
To work around this limitation, the backend prototype relies on timeouts.
The proper solution to this issue would be to add non-blocking I/O support to Raw Gadget.


## Troubleshooting

As a generic guidance to troubleshooting Raw Gadget errors:

1. Switch to the [dev branch](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget/tree/dev).

    This branch might contain fixes for some known issues.

2. Enable debug output for Raw Gadget (and Dummy HCD/UDC if you're using it).

    To do this, add the following line to the very beginning of `raw_gadget/raw_gadget.c`:

    ``` c
    #define DEBUG
    ```

    Then rebuild and reinsert the module.

3. Check the kernel log via `dmesg` to figure out what is failing.


### No such device

`USB_RAW_IOCTL_RUN` returns `ENODEV`, error code `19`:

```
ioctl(USB_RAW_IOCTL_RUN): No such device
```

This error means that bad UDC driver/device names were provided.
Make sure that the UDC driver module is loaded.
Also see [USB Device Controllers](#usb-device-controllers) about UDC names.


### Cannot send after transport endpoint shutdown

Endpoint operations return `ESHUTDOWN`, error code `108`:

```
ioctl(USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP0_WRITE): Cannot send after transport endpoint shutdown
```

This error means that the emulated USB device tried to perform a read or write operation on a disabled endpoint.
This error is usually observed when the host decides to reset the device during its operation, following which the UDC driver disables all enabled endpoints.

Often, a reset happens when the device emulation code does something wrong.
For example, provides a bad USB descriptor that is either malformed or inconsistent with the emulated device speed or other parameters.
As a result, either the UDC driver or the host resets or disconnects the device.

However, a reset can happen during the normal device operation.
For example, the host might decide to reconfigure the device and thus will reset it.
The UDC driver will then deactivate all endpoints and any attempt to perform an endpoint operation will fail with `ESHUTDOWN`.
When this happens, Raw Gadget will issue a `USB_RAW_EVENT_RESET` event (or `USB_RAW_EVENT_DISCONNECT` [for](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget/issues/48) `dwc2`).
The device emulation code needs to gracefully handle `ESHUTDOWN`, disable all Raw Gadget endpoints when hanlding the `USB_RAW_EVENT_RESET` event, restart enumeration, and reenable the endpoints when handling a new `SET_CONFIGURATION` request.
